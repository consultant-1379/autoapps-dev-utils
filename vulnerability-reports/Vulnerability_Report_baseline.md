## Results and Mitigations

Summary of found vulnerabilities are presented in the following table.
Tag consists of a severity level (C (Critical), H (High), M (Medium), L (Low),
U (Unknown), I (Info)) and an increasing serial number for example M1.
Since several tools reports additional security levels, the following will
be the translation table that show what the Tag severity level represent:

* Critical: Will include CRITICAL severity
* High: Will include ERROR, HIGH and IMPORTANT severity
* Medium: Will include MEDIUM and MODERATE severity
* Low: Will include LOW and WARNING severity
* Unknown: Will include UNKNOWN severity
* Informational: Will include INFO, INFORMATIONAL, NEGLECTABLE, and NON severity

Note that the Slogan field in the table could be derived from the description, CWE, CVE or Plugin and the Link field will be an internal link in the
document to the corresponding vulnerability. **Manual action is needed in case of duplicated entries of the same vulnerability in the summary table
below. Use the Link field to add a reference from the vulnerabilities that will not be used to the one that will be used. For example in Link field,
Refer to H1.**

MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared

*Description*
: The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the
origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific,
this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of
another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching
servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments,
for instance.

*Description*
: snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to
1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.

The function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by
multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can
cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value,
a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code
that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such
as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may
cause the same issue.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.

*Description*
: snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to
1.1.10.1, causing an unrecoverable fatal error.

The function `compress(char[] input)` in the file `Snappy.java` receives an array of characters and compresses it. It does so by multiplying the
length by 2 and passing it to the rawCompress` function.

Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by two can cause an integer overflow and become negative. The rawCompress function then uses the
received length and passes it to the natively compiled maxCompressedLength function, using the returned value to allocate a byte array.

Since the maxCompressedLength function treats the length as an unsigned integer, it doesnâ€™t care that it is negative, and it returns a valid value,
which is casted to a signed integer by the Java engine. If the result is negative, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will be raised
while trying to allocate the array `buf`. On the other side, if the result is positive, the `buf` array will successfully be allocated, but its size
might be too small to use for the compression, causing a fatal Access Violation error.

The same issue exists also when using the `compress` functions that receive double, float, int, long and short, each using a different multiplier that
may cause the same issue. The issue most likely wonâ€™t occur when using a byte array, since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other
negative value) is impossible in the first place.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.

*Description*
: snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions
prior to 1.1.10.1.

The code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting
to read 4 bytes. If it wasnâ€™t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them
as the length of the next chunk.

In the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesnâ€™t test the
legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise
a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would
raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.

*Description*
: snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable
to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an
unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix
has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
only accept compressed data from trusted sources.

: There is a flaw in RPM&#39;s signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys are associated with a primary key via a &#34;binding signature.&#34; RPM does
not check the binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them. If an attacker is able to add or socially engineer another party to add a
malicious subkey to a legitimate public key, RPM could wrongly trust a malicious signature. The greatest impact of this flaw is to data integrity. To
exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM or public key. It is
strongly recommended to only use RPMs and public keys from trusted sources. There is a flaw in RPM&#39;s signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys are

*Description*
: jackson-databind through 2.15.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact via a crafted object that uses cyclic
dependencies. NOTE: the vendor&#39;s perspective is that this is not a valid vulnerability report, because the steps of constructing a cyclic data
structure and trying to serialize it cannot be achieved by an external attacker.

*Description*
: A missing allocation check in sftp server processing read requests may cause a NULL dereference on low-memory conditions. The malicious client can
request up to 4GB SFTP reads, causing allocation of up to 4GB buffers, which was not being checked for failure. This will likely crash the
authenticated user&#39;s sftp server connection (if implemented as forking as recommended). For thread-based servers, this might also cause DoS for
legitimate users.Given this code is not in any released versions, no security releases have been issued.
